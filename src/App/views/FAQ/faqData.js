    title: 'How much does AncestorCloud cost?',
    content: <p>Using AncestorCloud to view and post requests and participate in the community is free. AncestorCloud's ability to provide these services comes from a small portion of the reward exchanged after research help has been completed to the requester's satisfaction.</p>

    title: 'How does helping others work?',
    content: <p>To help others simply begin searching our requests and click “Submit A Proposal” on any requests you are confident you can fulfill. We then will notify the seeker of your interest so they can approve you for that request. Once you’re approved and the reward is deposited into our secure holdings we will notify you and you can get started.</p>

    title: 'What if nobody helps with my requests?',
    content: <p>If your request isn’t responded to we will reach out personally to help you find what you are looking for. We’ve seen the best results achieved when the reward is fair, the details are clear, and all relevant documents are upload.</p>

    title: 'What happens if I do the work and the requester doesn\'t pay?',
    content: <p>You’ll never have to worry about not getting paid for a job. Whenever you begin completing a request, we will have already collected the funds for the request, holding them in reserve. Upon completion of the task, we securely deliver the funds to you for that task.</p>

    title: 'What if I am unhappy with the research?',
    content: <p>Please remember that genealogy is not an exact science. There may be times that a helper completes the research they agreed to do in their research proposal, but do not find the results you hoped for. In these cases, please remember the benefits of negative searches, as well as the time and effort they invested in your research, and reward them for accomplishing the searches they agreed to do. However, if a helper does not complete the research they agreed to do, we ensure a refund of your money.</p>
