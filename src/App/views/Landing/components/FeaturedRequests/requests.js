  description: "My 2nd GGF, Ernst Otto Stelzner, was born 29 Apr 1818 in Dobeln. He married my 2nd GGM, Eugenie Emile Hunger 17 Feb 1846 in the church of St. Nicolas, Dobeln. They then emigrated to the US in March 1846 settling in Ripley Co, Indiana. I am attempting to find more information on my Stelzner family in Dobeln. Ernst's father was Carl August Ferdinand Stelzner married to Friedericke Petzsch. Per Ernst's Baptism record, he was the third child. Looking for any information on his siblings or parents. Baptism information was from the church of St. Nicolas in Dobeln. I believe they have family information on site.",

  description: 'Hi, i know very little of my great grandfather Thomas M. Wilson. From my grandfather, He told me he was born in Virginia or West Virginia. According to one of the only records I have, a marriage certificate from ND dated May 1895, he was 43. So he may have been born between 1850-1853. He does not show up in any census records. He may be in 1860. but its difficult to trace due there are so many of them. I have a couple candidates. He dropped out of my grandfather\'s life in 1899. I have some other background. thank you steve',

  title: 'Looking for Matelli/Puccini',
  reward: 100,
  description: 'Hello all, I am new to this community. I have been doing research on many sides of my family history for many years. I have put together quite the "pile" of information. I am planning a trip to Italy in June of 2017 and want to see if I can get more information on my ancestors that came over. My great grandfather Edoardo Matelli came over in 1904 and was 32 at the time he left. He was born on May 9, 1872 and is from Decimo. He married Angela Puccini and had a son Paolino. Angela and Paolino came over in 1908. Angela is from Ghivizzano and was born June 26, 1879. I know, from stories, that we had farm land and that Angela was well know for her sense of style. When the new fashions from Paris came out, she would have a seamstress make the same style for her. I am looking to get more information on both sides and hopefully be able to go back even farther and visit these places during my trip next year. Thank you, in advance, for any help or advice.',

  title: 'Looking for Isaac Gerard/Gerrard/Garrard, born ca. 1756 in Berkeley County, VA (now WVA)',
  reward: 75,
  description: 'Isaac is the son of Revolutionary War patriot John Garrard, and is mentioned in John\'s will. Isaac\'s wife is identified as Rachel Hayes in a family memoir that is unfortunately unavailable; I believe I am descended from them via their daughter Sarah Gerard who married Nathaniel Buntin (that latter fact is well documented). Looking for research that will prove Isaac/Rachel\'s marriage and that Sarah Gerard Buntin is their daughter. Rachel outlived Isaac and died intestate in Ohio (1820 probate documents show sale of her estate but do not establish generational succession). Isaac and Rachel moved from VA to Garard\'s Fort, Greene Cty, PA around 1785, and later (around 1798) to Hamilton Cty, and Greene Cty (confusingly!), OH. We don\'t know when Isaac died; Rachel died in 1820. Would greatly appreciate anyone finding proof of Isaac/Rachel marriage and birth of their daughter Sarah.',
