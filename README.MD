A lightweight, opinionated setup to get up and going on react projects using
* react 0.14.0
* react-rotuer 1.0
* redux-router
* webpack
* babel
* CSS Modules
* redux


###Getting Started
* $npm install
* $npm start

###Folder Structure
Ideas borrowed liberally from: 
* Ryan Florence's [approach](https://gist.github.com/ryanflorence/daafb1e3cb8ad740b346) to organizing scalable, modular, team-centric react apps.
* Twitter's component-centric organizational [approach](http://www.thedotpost.com/2014/11/nicolas-gallagher-thinking-beyond-scalable-css) led by Nicolas Gallagher.
